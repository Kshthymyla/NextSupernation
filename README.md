# NextSupernation
The purpose of this project is to start a collaborative effort to guess what the next supernation might look like.
I'll start with writing my ideas, and hopefully other people would provide constructive criticism and share their ideas.


## Government Structure
The government governs only the shared resources, such as military, police, environment protection, immigration, and public roads.
Private sector takes care of all the things that are not intrinsically shared, such as education, health care, etc.


## Taxes
1. 1st time country entrance check fee.  New people coming into the country should pass the check.  Fingerprints are taken and retina scanned.
2. Land tax. The amount depends on land size and zoning.  That is, urban areas have hire tax rate than rural. 
3. Car tax.  The amount depends on car size.

The weight of each citizen's vote is proportional to the amount of taxes he have payed.


## Regulations
There are very few regulations.
* No government health care.  People are free to decide how they want to be treated and by whom.
* No government education.  People are free to decide how they want to learn and who will teach their kids.
* All substances are legal.  If someone choose to hurt himself with drugs - he is free to do so.


## Prisons
Prisons are private and self-funded by the labor provided by inmates.
Inmates can choose in which prison they are detained.


## Humanitarian Help
Private charitable organizations take care of the people in need. 
People are free to decide to which charity to donate and how much.

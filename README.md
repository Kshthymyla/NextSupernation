# NextSupernation
The purpose of this project is to start a collaborative effort to guess what the next supernation might look like.
I'll start with writing my ideas, and hopefully other people would provide constructive criticism and share their ideas.


## Government Structure
The government governs only the shared resources, such as military, police, environment protection, immigration, and public roads.
Private sector takes care of all the rest.


## Taxes
1. Federal tax. A fixed amount per year per person above 18 year old.  People who don't pay this tax don't vote.
2. Land tax. The amount depends on land size and zoning.  Urban areas have hire tax rate than rural. 
3. Car tax.  The amount depends on car size.


## Regulations
There are very few regulations.
* No government health care.  People are free to decide how they want to be treated and by whom.
* No government education.  People are free to decide how they want to learn and who will teach their kids.
* All substances are legal.  If someone choose to hurt himself with drugs - he is free to do so.


## Prisons
Prisons are private and self-funded by the labor provided by inmates.
Inmates can choose in which prison they are detained.


## Humanitarian Help
Private charitable organizations take care of the people in need. 
People are free to decide to which charity to donate and how much.
